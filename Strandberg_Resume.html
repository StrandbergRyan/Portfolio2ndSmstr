        <h3>GiveLight Foundation</h3>
        <p>Throughout my years in high school so far I've done some work in the GiveLight Club, or by another name, the <a href="https://www.givelight.org/news/2016/255-givelight-high-school-club.html">Givelight Foundation</a>. GiveLight really tries to make a difference in the world by helping raise money for those in need, such as orphans or the homeless.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>STAR Club</h3>
        <p>I've done work for STAR Club as well, which is a club with very similar essential goals to GiveLight.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Track & Field</h3>
        <p>I have competed in DHS's Track & Field team for two years as both a long-jumper and a sprinter. I've done one season per year from Freshman to Sophomore, with each season taking about three months. I also participated in Track pre-season conditioning in Sophomore year for five months before Track season arrived. I was able to make it to EBAL(East Bay Athletics League) and even further to NCS(the North Coast Section of the CIF), and recieved an athletic award for being able to make it that far.</p>
