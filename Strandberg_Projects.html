        <p>This game was my first project in CSP, done on <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a>. It was a rough journey to get it done since not every fucntion was cooperating as we thought it would, and there were constant adjustments due to that. Even at the end it wasn't as complete as desired, but it was the first. Our game (my partner and co-creator of the game being Anishkumar Senthil)was called Island Rush. This was a game where you had to choose your character of for visual preference, and then proceed to complete the levels that the game had to offer until you'd eventually get to the last one, and the game would have been won. Both me and Anish worked on very similar parts; programming the controls, sprites, and the levels. In the end, it was me that would do the boss level, which would be thought to have two choices, like a choose your own adventure game, except this was only once in the game that the result of the boss level would depend on. While he worked on a few levels that were leading up to that boss level. We constantly talked and shared things we thought we might've figured out to help the production of the game. Throughout the project we had to fill out a daily log that we'd type down what we did and how we cooperated as a team. And also we had to have a table of contents for all different versions of the Scratch Project that we might've worked on, and labeled correctly as well as to tell of their purpose. For example, the most crucial version of the project; the final version, was labeled as Island_Rush_Final with its link embedded.</p>
