            <h5>Who am I?</h5>
            <p>Hi, I'm Ryan Strandberg, and I'm currently attending Dublin High School as a Junior. A few of my simple hobbies are playing video games, listening to music, and hanging out with my friends.</p>
            <h5>My strengths/interests</h5>
            <p>A category that I've definitely grown on and improved over my years are my skills in Mathematics. When I got to High School and decided to seriously test myself in math, it was shown with my scores on how I was actually very good at it, and how I didn't seem to mind as much as others when it came to doing math. Math is a category that I'm always looking for a challenge in so I can test myself and improve.</p> 
            <p>One of my hobbies is running, which by the ending years of middle school I was figuring out I was considerably faster and more durable than the majority of the students.In late 8th grade I learned I was even wanted for the Track team there. Although it seemed late to join in middle school, me figuring out I was so good that the Track team wanted me lead to me joining the Track & Field team in Dublin High, which I can say has definitely been a positive experience for me. I had since then become interested in bettering and physically improving myself to become faster and stronger. During my two years of Track from Freshman to Sophomore year, I had some of the best times while also making new friends. Track will always be one of my favorite activities for the memories its given me, what I've learned from it, and the new friendships.</p>
            <p>Another hobby of mine is drawing. Ever since I was merely a kid that wanted to see what I could do with colored pencils and my own creativity, I've loved to draw ever since. I decided when I was 7 years old that I wanted to take art classes to see what more I could create. However, it didn't teach me a lot of how to exactly draw for  When I got to high school as a Freshman, I took a drawing class so I could officially learn how to draw certain things, like 3D art, correctly drawing faces, learning how too somewhat be able to draw without even looking down at the paper, different shadings with various colors; there was a lot that I learned form that class and I for sure enjoyed it, and wouldn't mind at all to give it a go again.</p>
            <h5>Why am I in Computer Science?</h5>
            <p>I decided to take CSP because of my curiosity of how computer science would be like, and if I could really possibly spring a career from it. I was also curious of seeing how I would work with my peers on certain projects. With what's been offered to me so far, it's definitely been a learning experience and I think I'm willing to expand on it and continue with Computer Science, even though I still don't exactly know what I'll decide to be in the future, I think CSP will give me something to help me steer in the right direction.</p>
